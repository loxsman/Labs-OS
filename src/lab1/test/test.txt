This topical collection aims to showcase the latest developments in photothermal materials and their
 applications in solar-driven water treatment and desalination technologies. The journal will publish
 innovative research on the design, synthesis, and performance evaluation of various photothermal ma
 terials, including plasmonic nanostructures, carbon-based nanomaterials, inorganic semiconductors, 
 and polymers, and their integration into membrane-based water purification systems.
