The interruption of amino acids supply has emerged as a promising anti-tumor strategy, with research focusing on the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer cells. Depletion of essential amino acids necessary for tumor growth has shown potential in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and inducing cell death. This approach has garnered significant interest in the field of cancer metabolism and targeted therapies, with studies exploring the mechanisms underlying amino acid depletionâ€™s anti-tumor effects and its potential as a therapeutic strategy across different cancer types.

Advancing our collective understanding in this area is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and developing effective anti-cancer interventions.
